    "# Assignment 3 Part 2 - Wiki Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission deadline:** Friday 30 May 2025, 11:55 pm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marks:** 20 marks (20% of the total unit assessment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless a Special Consideration request has been submitted and approved, a 5% penalty (of the total possible mark of the task) will be applied for each day a written report or presentation assessment is not submitted, up until the 7th day (including weekends). After the 7th day, a grade of ‘0’ will be awarded even if the assessment is submitted. For example, if the assignment is worth 8 marks (of the entire unit) and your submission is late by 19 hours (or 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds), 0.4 marks (5% of 8 marks) will be deducted. If your submission is late by 24 hours (or 47 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds), 0.8 marks (10% of 8 marks) will be deducted, and so on. The submission time for all uploaded assessments is 11:55 pm. A 1-hour grace period will be provided to students who experience a technical concern. For any late submission of time-sensitive tasks, such as scheduled tests/exams, performance assessments/presentations, and/or scheduled practical assessments/labs, please apply for Special Consideration.\n",

    "## A Note on the Use of AI Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we view AI code generators such as Copilot, CodeGPT, etc. as tools that can help you write code quickly. You are allowed to use these tools, but with some conditions. To understand what you can and cannot do, please visit these information pages provided by Macquarie University:\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence Tools and Academic Integrity in FSE - https://bit.ly/3uxgQP4\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to use these tools, make the following explicit in your submitted file as comments starting with \"Use of AI generators in this assignment\" explaining:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What part of your code is based on the output of such tools,\n",
    "-   What tools you used,\n",
    "-   What prompts you used to generate the code or text, and\n",
    "-   What modifications you made on the generated code or text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help us assess your work fairly. If we observe that you have used an AI generator and you do not give the above information, you may face disciplinary action.\n",

    "## Objectives of This Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- In Assignment 3 you will work on a general answer selection task. Given a question and a list of candidate sentences, the goal is to predict which sentences can be used as part of the answer. Assignment 3 Part 2 requires you to implement deep neural networks. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will work on the answer selection task using the WikiQA corpus. Given a question and a list of candidate sentences, the goal is to predict which sentences can be used to form a correct answer.  This assignment requires you to implement and evaluate a traditional text classification method (Naive Bayes) as well as deep neural networks (Siamese Network and Transformer models).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is the **Wiki Question Answering corpus from Microsoft**. The provided files (`training.csv`, `dev_test.csv`, `test.csv` in `data.zip`) contain the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `question_id`: ID for a question\n",
    "-   `question`: Text of the question\n",
    "-   `document_title`: Topic of the question\n",
    "-   `answer`: Sentence candidate for the answer\n",
