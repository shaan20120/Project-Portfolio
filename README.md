- ** Description: ** The puporse of this project was to effectively design an interactive Tableau dashboard featuring stacked charts, bubble charts, dropdowns, bar charts, and text elements to analyse the distribution of Movies and TV Shows, top genres, and ratings.
- ** Technologies: ** Tableau, Excel, GitHub(repository), Python(Pnadas Library)
- ** Objective: ** The purpose of this project was to create an interactive dashboard that helps  users to explore and discover recommendations for Movies and TV Shows across various genres and ratings through a detailed, user-friendly content analysis. This dashboard provides an effective insight onto popular genres, ratings, distribution of tv shows and movies and allows them to understand plot and insights on individual Movies and TV shows available on Netflix through drop downs.
- **How to Run:** To access this project please click on the link above and explore insights and recommendations of a range of Movies and TV Shows on Tableau Public.

## SuperStore Sales DashBoard and Mixed Rpeort
- ** Description: ** As a part of my University Coursework(BUSA 2020) I created a two page mixed report and two page dashboard within a span of three weeks on Power BI based on a hypothetical shipping company ‘SuperStore’ in the USA.
- ** Technologies: ** Power BI, Excel
- ** Objective: ** The purpose of this project was to use Power BI tools to create charts that analyse the historical data of SuperStore necessary for the mixed report and create two interactive dashboards with a specific purpose for each. The first dashboard helps analyse the sales over the four quarters for each year. Second dashboard helps analyse the sales data across United States. This enhanced my storytelling and dashboarding skills by conveying unique insights, which are transferrable in a business context by presenting unique insights to a wide range of stakeholders.
- **How to Run:** To access this project please download PowerBI desktop and download the link attached in this repository to access the file via PowerBI DeskTop.


## Melbourne Property Sales Predictive Model(Machine Learning)
- **Description:** This project consists of a predictive model in Python using Jupyter Notebook, implementing the Random Forest Regressor (non-linear regression) to predict property sales prices in Melbourne. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was implemented to clean and understand the data, exploring feature distributions and correlations.
- **Technologies:** Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, MatPlotlib, Sci-Kit libraries
- **Objective:** The objective was to create a predictive model in Python using Jupyter Notebook, implementing the Random Forest Regressor (non-linear regression model) to predict property sales prices in Melbourne. Implemented Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and understand the data, exploring feature distributions and correlations. Exploratory data analysis help understand the relationship between price and other features which in turn helps select the relevant model which can be trained, tested and evaluated. Therefore, I successfully developed a predictive model with an R-squared score of 0.72, effectively forecasting Melbourne property sales prices based on existing features. This R-Squared score shows that the model can effectively predict more accurate prices considering external factors such as investor confidence, interest rates, market sentiment, public policy, and more."
- **How to Run:** To access and run this project open Jupyter Notebook through downloading Anaconda Navigator. Upon downloading Navigator download the ipynb file from this repository and open it on Jupyter Notebook trhoguh pressing the upload icon.
